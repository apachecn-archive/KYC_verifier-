This is the suggested template for new EIPs.

Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the EIP number in title, irrespective of the category. 

## Abstract

- This EIP Provides defined interface for KYC verification with abstract on-chain conditions.

- This EIP defined the necessary interface functions to verify the identity of the wallet holder, based on the conditions described by the user on-chain.

## Motivation

On-chain verification is becoming indispensable across DeFi as well as other web3 protocols (DAO, governance) as needed by the government, but also by different DeFi protocols to whitelist the users which fulfil the certain criteria. This created the necessity of building on-chain verification of the addresses for token transfers (like stablecoin providers check for the blacklisted entities for the destination address, limited utility tokens for a DAO community , etc). 


current standards in the space, like [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) are insufficient to handle the complex usecases where: 

    -  The validation logic needs to be more complex than verification of the user identity wrt the blacklisted address that is DeFined offchain, and is very gas inefficient. 
    
    - also privacy enhanced/anonymous verification is important need by the crypto users in order to insure censorship/trustless networks. ZK based verification schemes are currently the only way to validate the assertion of the identity by the user, while keeping certain aspects of the providers identity completely private.

thus in order to address the two above major challenges: there needs to be creation of the identity verifier standard that will be validating the identity of the wallet holder.

## Specification: 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

**DeFinition**

- SBT: Soul Bound Tokens, these are non-fungible and non transferrable tokens that is used for DeFining the identity of the users. they are DeFined by standard [eip-5192](./eip-5192.md).

- SBT Certificates: SBT that represent that the owner hold ID signatures of the requirements defended in `function standardRequirement()`

**Functions**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    // getter function 
    /// @notice getter function to validate if the address `verifying` is the holder of the SBT DeFined by the tokenId `SBTID`
    /// @dev it MUST be DeFining the logic corresponding to all the current possible requirements DeFinition.
    /// @dev logic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=", ">")
    /// @param verifying is the  EOA address that wants to validate the SBT issued to it by the KYC. 
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT that user is the claimer.
    /// @return true if the assertion is valid, else false
    /**
    example ifVerified(0xfoo, 1) => true will mean that 0xfoo is the holder of the SBT identity token DeFined by tokenId of the given collection. 
    */
    function ifVerified(address verifying, uint256 SBTID) external view returns (bool);

    /// @notice getter function to fetch the onchain identification logic for the given identity holder.
    /// @dev it MUST not be DeFined for address(0). 
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT that user is the claimer.
    /// @return the struct array of all the descriptions of condition metadata that is DeFined by the administrator.
    /**
    ex: standardRequirement(1) => {
    { "title":"adult",
        "type": "uint",
        "description": "If this person is more than 18 years old",
        },
       "logic": ">=",
    "value":"18"  
}
DeFines the condition encoded for the identity index 1, DeFining the identity condition that holder must be more than 18 years old.
    */
    function standardRequirement(uint256 SBTID) external view returns (Requirement[] memory);

    // setter functions
    /// @notice function for setting the requirement logic (DeFined by Requirements metadata) details for the given identity token DeFined by SBTID.
    /// @devlogic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=",">")
    /// @dev it should only be called by the admin address.
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT based identity certificate for which admin wants to DeFine the Requirements.
    /// @param `requirements` is the struct array of all the descriptions of condition metadata that is DeFined by the administrator. check metadata section for more information.
    function changeStandardRequirement(uint256 SBTID, Requirement[] memory requirements) external returns (bool);
    
    /// @notice function which uses the ZKProof protocol in order to validate the identity based on the given 
    /// @dev it should only be called by the admin address.
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT based identity certificate for which admin wants to DeFine the Requirements.
    /// @param certifying is the address that needs to be proven as the owner of the SBT DeFined by the tokenID.
    /// @param `requirement` is the struct array of all the descriptions of condition metadata that is DeFined by the administrator. check metadata section for more information.
    function certify(address certifying, uint256 SBTID) external returns (bool);

    /// @notice function which uses the ZKProof protocol in order to validate the identity based on the given 
    /// @dev it should only be called by the admin address.
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT based identity certificate for which admin wants to DeFine the Requirements.
    /// @param certifying is the address that needs to be proven as the owner of the SBT DeFined by the tokenID.
    /// @param `requirement` is the structarray of all the descriptions of condition metadata that is DeFined by the administrator. check metadata section for more information.
    function revoke(address certifying, uint256 SBTID) external returns (bool);
```

**Events**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;   
/** 
    * standardChanged
    * @notice standardChanged MUST be triggered when requirements are changed. 
    * @dev standardChanged MUST also be triggered for the creation of new SBTID.
    */
    event standardChanged(uint256 SBTID, Requirement[]);   
    
    /** 
    * certified
    * @notice certified MUST be triggered when SBT certificate is given to certifiying address. 
    */
    event certified(address certifying, uint256 SBTID);
    
    /** 
    * revoked
    * @notice revoked MUST be triggered when SBT certificate is revoked. 
    */
    event revoked(address certifying, uint256 SBTID);
```

## Rationale

**Metadata structure**: 

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev metadata and Values structure of the Metadata, cited from [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) 
     */     
    struct Metadata {
        string title;
        string _type;
        string description;
    }
    
    /**
     * @dev Values here can be read and wrote by smartcontract and front-end, cited from [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) 
     */   
    struct Values { 
        string stringValue;
        uint uintValue;
        address addressValue;
        bool boolValue;
    }
```

**Requirement structure**:

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev structure that DeFines the parameters for specific requiremet of the SBT certificate
     * @notice this structure is used for the verification process, it chontains the metadata, logic and expectation
     * @logic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=",">")
     ex: standardRequirement => {
    { "title":"adult",
        "type": "uint",
        "description": "If this person is more than 18 years old",
        },
       "logic": ">=",
    "value":"18"  
	}
	DeFines the condition encoded for the identity index 1, DeFining the identity condition that holder must be more than 18 		years old.
    */
	
    struct Requirement {
        Metadata metadata;
        string logic;
        Values expectation;
    }
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Any existing token contract can use this interface to limit the access of certain functions to the address holding the right SBT certificate.

**Note that the this standard interface is also compatible with [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) 

However, the update is needed for the implementation of the KYC modifier.

## Test Cases

Test-case for the minimal reference implementation is [here](../test.sol). Use the Truffle box to compile and test the contracts.

## Reference Implementation

The [interface](../EIP3475.sol) contains two separated implementations:

- [verification_modifier](../SBT_certification.sol)
  - modifier that need to be implemented into the functions which need KYC certification


- [SBT_certification](../verification_modifier.sol)
  - functions required in SBT certificate contract

## Security Considerations

Writing functions:

`function changeStandardRequirement()`

`function certify()`

`function revoke()`

SHOULD require the admin role in the SBT certificate contract.
